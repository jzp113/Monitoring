Developing open-source ICO credit scores/histories generated by social media and exchange activity.

Currently tracking 900+ coins across 14 exchanges with 10-20 listings added daily.

**TODO**
* retrieve top account/shill/bot histories for correlation - maybe top 10 list for each w associated ico's
* auto add coin symbols to twitter filter on discovery
* track de-listings and symbols/groups for correlation
* capture all-time high/low price/volume at each exchange for newly discovered coins - report

**Exchange**
* dates of known listings/delistings including related coins
* tweeters & retweeters relationships
* top 10 active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers graphed. 
* inline lookup table mapping current group to related icos.


**Twitter**
* bot counts/analysis with metrics
* followers and total influence score
* confidence score based on the ml match

**explorer**
* need comparable basic block explorer/transaction stats
* display rich lists & potential slippage/total coins/total in circulation/rate of emission/brief hash rate comparisons where avail.

**Reporting**
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
