Automated logging system for examining ICO teams based on social media and exchange activity.
Currently tracking 3000+ listings across 18 exchanges with 200+ active twitter filters. For feedback or info on a specific ICO please message me on Twitter @JoshuaOpolko

**TODO**
* standalone profiler.

**Reporting/Workflow**
* need a formalized report format for manual, needs to abstract no raw tweets
* twitter autorespond so people can tag screen_names and both get brief report
* brief:'top 3 supporters by volume'


**Schedule**

* 5 minute poll all exchanges
* 10 minute check for new and add symbols to twitter filter
* 2:00 UTC daily poll for twitter activity on new ICOs
