Automated ICO tracking system for generating credit scores based on social media and exchange acitivity.

**TODO**

* efficient strategy for building team histories. has to be repeatable/automateable and open for review.
* steps for discover vs track 
* auto remove stock tickers/accounts based on brief history.


**Reporting**

* goal is to create a  simple pie chart for each current ico displaying affiliations by percentage along with  past performance of those projects.
* segments should be clickable for a individual scores/breakdowns/weightings as well as raw text samples w count to highlight spam, no names or timestamps/etc.
* rich list vs amount in circulation
* account age/length distributions visualized. scored out of a possible 3k maybe.
* rate of emission / cost to maintain current value
* brief hash rate comparisons with known coins has to have visual impact.
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
* top 10 *new* active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers charts.
* time of day/day of week trends per ico, follow the sun/national/timezone etc


**Schedule**

* 5 minute poll all exchanges
* 10 minute check for new and add symbols to twitter filter
* 6-24 hours collect top accounts and obtain histories - in progress
