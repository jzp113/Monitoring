Automated ICO tracking system for generating credit scores based on social media and exchange acitivity.

**TODO**

* auto add new symbols to twitter filter on discovery
* graph twitter team structures incl chronological for lead/members/bots/total followers/influence
* efficient strategy for obtaining team histories. basically grab top accounts, dump/count and cross-reference. 
* method/schema/etl for modelling, should be after histories are indexed. 
* capture snapshot of market info on discovery, for future not critical.
* need some kind of activity status check/alert for all new adds, which ones haven't gone active yet.

**Reporting**
* compare related listing/delistings
* display risk = rich lists w calc potential slippage
* total coins vs total in circulation and rate of emission = inflation/pre-mine/hidden mine/cost to maintain current value
* brief hash rate comparisons with known coins numeric ie: 0.000000000001% of btc or ibm or whatever. has to have visual impact.
* inline lookup mapping current group to related icos.
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
* top 10 *new* active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers charts.
* time of day/day of week trends per ico, follow the sun/national/timezone etc
