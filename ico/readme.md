Automated tracking system for scoring ICO teams based on social media and exchange activity.
Currently tracking 3000+ listings across 15 exchanges with 250+ active twitter filters. 

**TODO**

* automatic bot check - time/text
* add active=y/n to ico.coins
* check twitter for statuses before adding new symbols to filter
* regular check all symbols and flag new ones going active


**Reporting/Workflow**

* bot score/elimination
* score exchanges by listing fees
* percent current ico to total past symbols and total tweets
* chart of symbol count over time for screen_name and team for previous ico's compared with current.
* percent/summary of non-ico tweets from screen_name/team
* simple pie chart for each current ico displaying affiliations as percentage along with past performance of those projects.
* segments should be clickable for a individual scores/breakdowns/weightings as well as raw text samples with count to highlight spam, no names or timestamps/etc.
* github activity


**Schedule**

* 5 minute poll all exchanges
* 10 minute check for new and add symbols to twitter filter
