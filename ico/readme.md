Developing open-source ICO credit scores/histories generated by social media and exchange activity.

**TODO**

* auto add new symbols to twitter filter on discovery
* capture all-time high/low price/volume at each exchange for newly discovered coins - report
* track de-listings and symbols/groups for correlation

**Twitter**
* top 10 active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers charts. 
* tweeters vs retweeters vs bots social graphs
* follower count and total influence score
* confidence score based on matches 

**Explorer/Exchange**
* compare related listing/delistings
* display risk = rich lists w calc potential slippage
* total coins vs total in circulation and rate of emission = inflation/pre-mine/hidden mine/cost to maintain current value
* brief hash rate comparisons with known coins numeric ie: 0.000000000001% of btc or ibm or whatever. has to have visual impact.

**Reporting**
* inline lookup mapping current group to related icos.
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
