Automated tracking system for scoring ICO teams based on social media and exchange activity.
Currently tracking 3000+ listings across 15 exchanges with 250+ active twitter filters. Analyzing 2.3 million tweets daily.

**TODO**

* unique:dups per team, get rid of almost all bots right there.
* make list of unique ids before scan to not be hitting the same ones over and over.

**Reporting/Workflow**

* bot score/elimination
* score exchanges by listing fees
* percent current ico to total past symbols and total tweets
* volume breakdown for all current icos for screen_name/team 
* chart of symbol count over time for screen_name and team for previous ico's compared with current.
* percent/summary of non-ico tweets from screen_name/team
* simple pie chart for each current ico displaying affiliations as percentage along with past performance of those projects.
* segments should be clickable for a individual scores/breakdowns/weightings as well as raw text samples with count to highlight spam, no names or timestamps/etc.
* github activity


**Schedule**

* 5 minute poll all exchanges
* 10 minute check for new and add symbols to twitter filter
