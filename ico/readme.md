Automated ICO tracking system for generating credit scores based on social media and exchange acitivity.

**TODO**

* auto add new symbols to twitter filter on discovery
* team structures incl chronological/followers
* efficient strategy for obtaining relevant histories. basically grab each top guy, dump/count all the symbols then lookups=score.
* method/schema/etl for modelling, might have to be after histories are obtained. 
* capture market info snapshot on discovery, for future analysis not critical.
* check/alert for inactive symbols

**Twitter**
* top 10 *new* active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers charts. 
* tweeters vs retweeters vs bots social graphs
* follower count and total influence score
* confidence score based on matches 

**Reporting**
**Explorer/Exchange**
* compare related listing/delistings
* display risk = rich lists w calc potential slippage
* total coins vs total in circulation and rate of emission = inflation/pre-mine/hidden mine/cost to maintain current value
* brief hash rate comparisons with known coins numeric ie: 0.000000000001% of btc or ibm or whatever. has to have visual impact.
* inline lookup mapping current group to related icos.
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
