Automated ICO tracking system for generating credit scores based on social media and exchange acitivity.

**TODO**

* steps for discover vs track 
* auto remove stock tickers/accounts based on brief history.
* efficient strategy for building team histories. has to be repeatable/automateable and open for review.

**Reporting**

* goal is a simple colorful pie chart for each ico displaying associated groups by percentage. each segment should visually highlight % down from all time highs or last n months.
* pie chart segments should be clickable for a individual scores/breakdowns/weightings as well as raw text samples w count to highlight spam, no names or timestamps/etc.
* account age distribution as simply as poss. 
* compare related listing/delistings
* display risk = rich lists w calc potential slippage
* total coins vs total in circulation and rate of emission = inflation/pre-mine/hidden mine/cost to maintain current value
* brief hash rate comparisons with known coins numeric ie: 0.000000000001% of btc or ibm or whatever. has to have visual impact.
* inline lookup mapping current group to related icos.
* reported elements should be browsable and clearly scored/live data as much as possible.
* top 10 *new* active pump group/ico twitter trends/crossovers charts.
* time of day/day of week trends per ico, follow the sun/national/timezone etc
